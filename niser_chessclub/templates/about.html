                <h4>Welcome to our Club</h4>
                <p>
		Chess Club NISER, has been active ever since our institute found its new home in the picturesque campus of Jatni. It has been a premier club and aims at spreading CHESS as a culture in the institute and beyond. The club has the ultimate objective of bringing glory to the institute in various competitions and discover some good players which would be the epitome of individual and social development. This club is guided by its motto " Practice and Perseverance". Over the course of time, our club has grown progressively, with the influx of several seasoned campaigners and a good proportion of amateurs and is slowly gaining popularity. So, letâ€™s relive the journey of the club from scratch. We would make the website sufficiently detailed so as to give a clear idea to the viewers about our club activities and the achievements so far !
